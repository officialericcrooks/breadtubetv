title: "What Was I Digging Holes For? ❤️\U0001F5A4 Garden Revolutions"
description: |-
  Back out in the garden to show you what's happened over the last week and answer some questions from the internet.
  - What was I digging the holes for?
  - How am I going to grow on such bad soil?
  - Do I have any vegetables in my garden?

  Here's a question for you all, have you checked out #EarthStrike yet? Also did you know that humanity has wiped out 60% Of World's Animals Since 1970?
