title: What are the Values of an Anarchist Economy  - Michael Albert
description: |-
  This is an edited clip from a much larger lecture given by Michael Albert and uploaded by Radical Reviewer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVHmaDdYNT0

  All this content comes from the first ~ 10 minutes of the source, I have taken liberties in cutting certain anecdotes and jokes in an attempt to make this shorter and easier to digest, I also transcribed the work myself (comments welcome) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JeqV2aTdhKyNAcF0HKx8vtvcQ1v3p0726gYJdijBRWI/edit#heading=h.6cjgdpf9vea0

  I highly recommend the entire talk, as well as Michael Albert's book and other work on Participatory Economics
