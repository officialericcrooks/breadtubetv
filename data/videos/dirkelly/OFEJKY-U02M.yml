title: Dirk Kelly - Towards a Green New Deal, US Focus
description: |-
  Part of the discussion we held at the Boorloo Activist Centre with the Socialist Alliance in November 2019. I focus on The Green New Deal in the context of the United States. The other two speakers discussed United Kingdom and Australia, more of this content to be posted at a later date.


  Sorry about the audio, we are planning on upgrading the AV at the centre.
