  Wisecrack is a collective of comedians, academics, filmmakers, and artists who are super curious about the world around us. Our channel explores big ideas in unusual (and hopefully super entertaining) ways. We dive into philosophy and critical thinking through the lens of movies, TV shows, video games, and books.
