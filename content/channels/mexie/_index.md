  PhD graduate from Toronto. I studied Human Geography / Political Ecology, focusing on the intersections between political economy and global environmental governance. This sobering experience has led me to be the staunch anti-capitalist, vegan activist you see today! I make educational videos about political economy/capitalism, environmental issues, veganism, and issues relating to social/economic justice
