description: How can the richest countries and continents in resources and people
  be impoverished? If your house gets broken into, who is to blame? Buy a burglar
  alarm in the form of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist class analysis and struggle. You like
  what I do? You want to improve the production quality of my videos? You just want
  to show appreciation? Have some white guilt you want to absolve? Want to pay me
