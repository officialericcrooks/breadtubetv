description: 'My senior thesis presentation for my B.A. in African American studies.
  Questions I''m working to answer: "What inspires New Afrikan people, both historically
  and today, in the United States, to pick up the gun to defend themselves? What is
  the commonality between then and now? What are the differences? What are the differences
  and contradictions between the Euro-American gun rights movement and the New Afrikan
  gun rights movement? What are the differences between non-male and male relations
  to the gun in the New Afrikan nation? What were (and are) the state responses to
  New Afrikan armed self-defense and gun ownership in general?"'
