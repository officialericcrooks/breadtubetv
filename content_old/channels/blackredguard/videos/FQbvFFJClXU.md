description: We can't do without a proletarian state anymore than we can do without
  smashing the bourgeois state. This is not love of violence, or love of authority,
  but a recognition of the seriousness of our work and our struggle, and the recognition
  that scientific oppression requires a scientific, not an emotional response." -
