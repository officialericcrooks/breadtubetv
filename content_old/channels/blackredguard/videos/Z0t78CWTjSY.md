description: 'Some of these methods used by neo-colonialists to slip past our guard
  must now be examined. The first is retention by the departing colonialists of various
  kinds of privileges which infringe on our sovereignty: that of setting up military
  bases or stationing troops in former colonies and the supplying of ‘advisers’ of
  one sort or another. Sometimes a number of ‘rights’ are demanded: land concessions,
  prospecting rights for minerals and/or oil; the ‘right’ to collect customs, to carry
  out administration, to issue paper money; to be exempt from customs duties and/or
  taxes for expatriate enterprises; and, above all, the ‘right’ to provide ‘aid’."
