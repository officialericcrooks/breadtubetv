description: 'Hey sodomites! Welcome to da very first episode of "At Da Freaking Movies!"
  Today I''m reviewing an awesome freaking movie dats going to hit theaters on September
  26th titled "A Matter of Freaking Faith". I really tink diss is going to signal
  da tipping point in America where we realize dat Biblical Creation can no longer
  be ignored as a viable scientific alternative to evolution. In fact, I''m hoping
  dat it causes rioting in da freaking streets and dee eventual removal of evolution
  from are classrooms al-to-freaking-tether. follow me on freaking twitter already:
