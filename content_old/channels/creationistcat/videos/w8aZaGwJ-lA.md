  ✔Buy the T-Shirt: http://CreationistCatTees.com ANY purchase of the multitude of
  Tees offered at CreationistCatTees.com helps CC Ministries quite a freakin'' bit!
  To make everything absolutely clear I totally condemn this. It was a clear false
  flag, AIU does not deserve a strike like this, he didn''t do anything that violated
  YT''s terms of service and although I understand his video was a cavalcade of bullcrap,
  he''s got a right to free speech like da rest of us. Super Duper Awesome "Burn In
  Hell" Animation by Eduard Riegel Stalk me on Twitter and Facebook why don''t cha?
