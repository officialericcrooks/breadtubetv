  sound out of the merry go round when the outlaws deciphered the code but theres
  a price on their heads they were poisoned in bed before they ever reached their
  buried gold and its too early to tell if this is heaven or hell so let it go let
  it go let it go as we move from the crowd to the outskirts of town we were running
  up the foot of the hill and across from the trash the scattered millions burn fast
  and the flames have grown greedier still yes and i amazed how very little has changed
  from day to day to day to day (today today taking it day to day to day) Twitter
