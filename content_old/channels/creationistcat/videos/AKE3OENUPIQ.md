  data i18n layouts netlify.toml public resources scripts static Da issue of TYT already
  being a "partner" with Al Jazeera has been brought up by many. I knew this before
  making da video (I refer to this partnership in THIS video at 8:50!) it''s where
  I first got da information about Roo''s stance on this in da first place and I do
  make mention of this video on my appearance on the Drunken Peasants da day I premiered
  dish one. A "partnership" with Al Jazeera is not sufficient evidence of TYT being
  paid to completely distort the news and create a pro-Islamic narrative. Just because
  they happen to have this partnership does not mean that they were distorting the
  news at AL Jazeera''s say so at all. This is a VERY damning claim and far more evidence
  is required to substantiate it than just a casual partnership between the two (which
  has not even produced that much content.) In the description of one video titled
  "Al Jazeera Refuses To Use The Word “Terrorist” Roo describes TYT as having an "allegiance"
  to Al Jazeera, then goes on to say "The Muslim apologetics and propaganda machine
  is in full swing." Clearly Roo is claiming that TYT is deliberately shifting the
  news to create a VERY pro Islamic narrative. He is claiming TYT is not presenting
  a version of the news they find authentic and has essentially been bought out. Again,
  a casual partnership with another network is not sufficient evidence they are participating
  in this extremely dishonest act. I include a link within this video where Cenk outlines
  why he left MSNBC. It was a mutual decision made due to the fact Cenk could not
  hold his tongue when it came to many issues that MSNBC did not want him to speak
  out against. His ratings were more than decent and if he chose to conform he could
  have had an extremely lucrative job and the possibility of TYT being absorbed into
  the MSNBC also seemed like a likely possibility. I believe the fact that he did
  not enter into this partnership speaks volumes about the Al Jazeera situation. There
  is certainly more that can be said about this, but I''m not going to write a dissertation.
  It breaks down to what I''ve already said, a casual business partnership is not
  sufficient evidence of TYT doing something that dishonest and unethical. ****This
  is not a defense of TYT. This is a very basic debunking of a conspiracy theory that
  Roo has brought forward. I would do the same thing for Fox News or any other news
  source if I felt the evidence being brought to the table was as poor as Roo''s.****
  I have NO PROBLEM with criticizing TYT for a myriad of other reasons. There''s certainly
  a lot to choose from, but in this case I defend TYT in da shame way one might defend
  GWB from allegations of him masterminding 9/11 by "truthers". CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE

  scripts static New Addendum written on October 18th***** In AIU''s new vid (which,
  nope I haven''t watched and I won''t) he shows lots of clips from AJ+ and TYT collabs.
  In this playlist featured on the TYT channel there are just 25 videos after a seven
  month partnership: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJRjPUKULQ8&list=PLTpcK80irdQiwRoXhszOgDzI7CmWwTO4n
  AIU mocks me for supposedly being ignorant of a wealth of videos their partnership
  has produced. But you must take into account that TYT typically produces more than
  this much material in five days. Many of these videos are under five minutes. And
  PLEASE keep in mind that about a quarter of these or more were produced AFTER I
  posted my video. But even if all of them were produced at the time I posted my video,
  is that really much material at all? I definitely don''t think so. ****Update August
  28 2016**** Checked that playlist again, no more videos have been added to it in
  nearly a year. :P'
