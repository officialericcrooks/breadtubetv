  Lyrics:
  I know diss guy named Brock Lawly, if I didn't know him, he'd be da guy I didn't know... So I go to my computer, to Tweet Brock Lawly And then I tweet him
  I'm Tweeting Brock Lawley, tweeting Brock Lawley, I'm Tweeting! Brock Lawley, tweeting Brock Lawley... x 2
  Everyting he says is great can't freaking believe it, these are the awesomest tweets, so I log on to the computer, to Tweet Brock Lawly... I'm tweeting brock lawly.... Etc.
  Everyting you right is so freaking neat but did you ever have a feeling that you just can't tweet...
  So look into my eyes Brock, The ones that read your tweets cuz when this world ends it's you and me in heaven and man dats pretty freaking sweet...
  Brock Lawley, Brock Lawley, Brock Lawly, I'm tweeting Brock Lawley........
