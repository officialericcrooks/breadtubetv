  NOTE: if you are interested and financially capable of doing MORE than talking,
  I recommend picking up a copy of Civility in the Digital Age (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789750244/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0789750244&linkCode=as2&tag=civilination-20).
  It''s a valuable resource for improving online communities, and all proceeds go
  to CiviliNation, a non-profit resource for dealing with and preventing online harassment.
