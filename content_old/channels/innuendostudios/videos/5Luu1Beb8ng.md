  The primary resources for this video are: Fascism Today, by Shane Burley How Propaganda
  Works, by Jason Stanley The Authoritarians, by Bob Altemeyer You can read my notes
  on How Propaganda Works here: https://twitter.com/InnuendoStudios/status/959598105846050821

  For further reading on the conservative upsurge in transphobia after the legalization
  of gay marriage, try the essay "My Vagina is Haunted" in the book Neoreaction a
  Basilisk by Elizabeth Sandifer. The observation that whiteness is a social construct
  invented to justify white supremacy can be further researched in the works of Ibram
  X. Kendi; his major text on race is Stamped from the Beginning. (I confess, I know
  Kendi''s arguments from podcasts and various other people citing him; Stamped from
  the Beginning is on my reading list but I haven''t gotten to it yet. He''s by no
  means the only person pointing out how whiteness works, but he''s famous for being
  the best.)'
