  Republican campaigners judging Far Right voters while still making a point to get
  them registered (NOTE: this is an article - in my opinion, a very insightful one
  - by Matt Taibbi, who has since come under fire for some really disgusting sexual
  abuse allegations. this is a mirrored version of a fairly long article, which I
  think is worth reading anyway, but he won''t get any traffic if you read it, I won''t
  blame you if you don''t, and my linking to his writing does not mean I approve of
  him as a human) - http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1244020/posts'
