description: Here is Episode 4 of 5 of my series on liberalism, an exploration of
  the dark side of liberal theory. This miniseries is adapted in large part for the
  arguments of Ishay Landa in his book "The Apprentice's Sorcerer". This Episode and
  the next one specifically look at the relationship between liberalism and fascism.
