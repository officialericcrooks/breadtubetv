description: Trans people do not present a threat in gendered spaces. Also it has
  been brought to my attention i should have used the term assigned gender in some
  places where i have used birth gender. I am really sorry for any offence caused.
  The YouTube description box is too small so I have listed the core sources, scientific
  studies and data and links to trans and non binary channels here, but the full description
  with links to all sources is in a pinned comment below.
