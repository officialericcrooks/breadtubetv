title: What is the myth of barter?

description: '#capitalism #history #adamsmith Since the dawn of civilization, humans
  would trade shoes for shirts and spears for food. And then money was created because
  that was too complicated. Or something like that, I never payed to much attention
  in Econ or History. Either way, surprise, that was all a lie! Surprised that something
  they teach in primary school wasn''t the truth? Me neither.'
