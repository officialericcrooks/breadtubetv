description: Throughout history, the answer to this question has been an easy, resounding,
  yes. Certain individuals exist to be ruled, and others exist to be rulers. Thankfully,
  meritocracy and liberal democracy has ushered in a world where we no longer need
  birth lotteries and such. Today, all success is guaranteed by effort and a little
  bit of charisma. Right?
