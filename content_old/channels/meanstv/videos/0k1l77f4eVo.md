date: "2019-09-15T10:33:48+08:00"
description: The corporate media, in an effort to delegitimize the rising movement
  of socialism, erases the legacy of black and brown organizers through the "Bernie
  Bro" narrative. But don't get it confused — class struggle is something that has
  always been championed by people of color.
