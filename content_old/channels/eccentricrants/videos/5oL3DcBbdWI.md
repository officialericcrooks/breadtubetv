description: '---ADDITIONAL NOTES--- Feel free to share this video anywhere someone
  is spouting these statistics. During pride month, I''ve seen a lot of people share
  such stats, which inspired me to make this video. Hopefully, this will give allies/homosexuals
  more ammunition in the fight against the alt-right. (Also, sorry for the quick editing.
  I really wanted to get this video out before the end of June.) Thanks to Towels#5301
  on Discord for helping me do research for this video. --LINKS & RESOURCES-- Eccentric
