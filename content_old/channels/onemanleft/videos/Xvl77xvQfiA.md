title: Left To Defend

description: A song about hope for the future and worry that we're running out of
  time. Someday we won't have to commodify our lives just to survive. Someday.. oh,
  someday Someday men won't have to die for the bottom line of wealthy men, and the
  governments that they hide behind. Frankly I'm sick of waiting for it, lets cut
  to the chase, strike at the root of it.. frankly I'm sick, Frankly I'm sick! we're
  running out of time, society's in decline, the vacuous cultural hegemony of capital
  is making me sick.. it's making me sick! I don't want to sound like an accelerationist
  but the clocks ticking faster than it's ever been. We've got to act now, we've got
  to make it count or there'll be nothing left to defend. Someday all these fascist
  pigs will lie motionless I hope I witness it.. Someday.. oh, someday. Someday their
  mass graves will be just another place to piss, I hope I witness it.. Someday..
  Frankly I'm sick of waiting for it, lets cut to the chase, strike at the root of
  it.. frankly I'm sick, Frankly I'm sick! we're running out of time, society's in
  decline, the vacuous cultural hegemony of capital is making me sick.. it's making
  me sick! I don't want to sound like an accelerationist but the clocks ticking faster
  than it's ever been. We've got to act now, we've got to make it count or there'll
  be nothing left to defend.
