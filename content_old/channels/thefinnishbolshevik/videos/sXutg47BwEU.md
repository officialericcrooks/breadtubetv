description: 'SOME BACKGROUND: Stephen Kotkin is a right-wing historian who specializes
  on the Stalin period. I don''t agree with his views, he is a conservative and a
  pretty classical anti-communist. However some of the research, especially regarding
  primary source documents is interesting. Its worth pointing out that the idea that
  the "Testament" of Lenin was a forgery was not invented by Kotkin. Many marxists
  also believed this to be the case. One of the proponents of the forgery hypothesis
  is V. Sakharov: The Forgery of the ''Lenin Testament'' http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv7n1/LenTest.htm
  Some have also alleged that Lenin did dictate the document but had lost his senses
  due to illness. This was the opinion of Lenin''s sister Maria Ulyanova. However
  this might be a convenient cover for her mother Krupskaya. Krupskaya had to have
  known about the forgery if it took place. However she became a support of Stalin''s
  despite her earlier support for Zinoviev. Therefore this explanation could have
  been most convenient for all in the Stalin-team. The charge leveled against Stalin
  in the "testament" is not one about politics, but about "rudeness". The bizarre
  nature of the charge contributed to the idea that it was not written by Lenin at
  all, or at least not when in full possession of his faculties. Stalin himself never
  publicly discussed the authenticity of the "testament", instead he apologized and
  accepted the charge of "rudeness" but turned it into a weapon against his opponents,
  saying he can''t help being rude to those who harm the Bolshevik party. Lenin''s
  "testament" is mostly brought up by Trotskyists. In deed the term was invented by
  them. However when hearing about most people think Lenin allegedly wanting to choose
  a successor is very anti-Lenin & anti-Bolshevik thing to do. It goes against his
  character to do such a thing. Lenin would have respected the party''s vote, and
  certainly wouldn''t have let personal issues or "rudeness" intervene with politics.
  In the 1930s Trotsky claimed Lenin allegedly named him his successor in his "testament".
  However in 1925 Trotsky said: "Lenin has not left any “Testament”; the character
  of his relations to the party, and the character of the party itself, preclude the
  possibility of such a “Testament.” ~Trotsky, Letter on Eastman''s book Trotsky could
  have been pressured into saying this, as anything else would have resulted in merciless
  ridicule by rival politicians. But its also possible Trotsky simply had more honesty
  and guts in 1925 then in his later years. My own thoughts on the alleged forgery
