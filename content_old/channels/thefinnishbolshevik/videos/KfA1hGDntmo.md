description: 'Me and Zach (Morbid Gameplay) talk about the Holodomor for an hour and
  watch a video response to me by a user called "Give Me Liberty Give Me Freedom".
  At first we were gonna respond to some arguments but it quickly became obvious there
  weren''t any. The video was completely pointless and baseless so we just used as
  a loose context for our discussion. If Give Me Liberty wants an actual point by
  point refutation of his arguments and claims then he should: 1) Make specific claims,
  not contradictory bs that goes all over the place 2) Back them up with actual source
  so that I could check them out. Don''t link an entire website. If the site is your
  source then point to a specific section. 3) Refute my points or debunk my evidence
  in my original video because it already largely disproves most of the shit in your
  video before hand. Your response just did not even show more then a couple of seconds
  of my video and deliberately neglected to even deal with it at all. Its hardly even
  a response. His miserable video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0e25jzq40o'
