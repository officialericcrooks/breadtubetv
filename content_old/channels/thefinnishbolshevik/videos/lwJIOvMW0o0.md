title: 'Marxist Theory 101 #4: The State (Bourgeois and Proletarian Dictatorship)'
date: "2019-09-15T10:39:19+08:00"
description: -State is an instrument of class rule -Every state has a class character
  and a ruling class -In modern society this class can be the capitalists or the workers
  -When marxists refer to a proletarian dictatorship or a bourgeois dictatorship they
  mean a society controlled by one class -There is no general democracy where all
  classes can be equal -the proletarian dictatorship is a worker's democratic state
  where the majority (workers and their allies) rule over the remnants of the capitalist
  class and it's allies
