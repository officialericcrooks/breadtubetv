description: 'This is a video showcasing some of the things that were achieved during
  Socialism in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Mostly focusing on the Stalin
  era because thats when most of the breakthroughs happened but also the time of Lenin
  and shortly after Stalin''s death in the 50s. Besides really its not about figureheads,
  its about what the society as a whole achieved in the worker''s state. I will be
  making a follow up video highlighting the failures of Soviet revisionism that followed
  and dismantled the USSR. Feel free to ask any questions. Footage is from various
  documentaries on Youtube and from videos posted by comrade Kalinin1917. He uploaded
  a video with really nice color footage from the Soviet Union from the 1940s and
  stuff like that which I simply had to take advantage of. Music: T44 - Power Of The
  Soviet Will T44 - Don''t F_ck With The USSR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYBedAVIl6Q
  T44 - Sacred War(cover) Slaughter 2017 - Set The World On Fire Soviet. Death Metal
