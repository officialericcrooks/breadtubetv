  Black Cat https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM0GMDJL76cwUji2m6u3dkg Chomsky has a
  truly unique position on Bolshevism & Marxism -- a truly idiotic position that is!
  The mind boggles. His argument is the complete opposite of the typical dogmatist
  "orthodox marxist" or Menshevik argument. While those people argue that the Bolsheviks
  were too pro-peasant and shouldn't have attempted socialism in a peasant country
  Chomsky says the opposite. In fact he says that the Bolsheviks were totally anti-peasant!
  Chomsky goes even further then that and claims that Marx was a Narodnik. Keep in
  mind that Narodnik's were explicitly anti-Marxist.
