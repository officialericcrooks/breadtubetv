description: Just some thoughts. Basically I think some people get too deeply into
  "idpol" at the cost of marxism, while others are quick to reject any movement as
  "idpol" and degenerate into bourgeois-conservatism or vulgar marxism. How Does Socialism
  Solve Racism, Sexism & Other Oppression? (or, How to better understand the Relation
  between Base & Superstructure) https://mltheory.wordpress.com/2017/07/16/how-does-socialism-solve-racism-sexism-other-oppression/
