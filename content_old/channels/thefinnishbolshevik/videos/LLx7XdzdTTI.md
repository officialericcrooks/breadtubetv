description: Original ITF Taekwondo became more popular in North Korea while WTF Taekwondo
  was created by South Korea and the USA to replace ITF. WTF has since become more
  popular worldwide but both styles are still practiced. Founder of Taekwondo, Choi
  Hong Hi was a Korean nationalist anti-japanese fighter who later became a general
  in the South Korean army. He defected to North Korea in 1979. He is seen as unimportant
  or a traitor among WTF Taekwondo organizations. General Choi founded the "International
  Taekwondo Federation" (ITF) in 1966. South Korea created the "World Taekwondo Federation"
  (WTF) in 1973 when Choi was in political exile in Canada.
