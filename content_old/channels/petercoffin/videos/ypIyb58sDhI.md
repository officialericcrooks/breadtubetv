  LAST NIGHTLY takes on the recent Dave Rubin Sargon stream, where Sargon of Akkad
  Dave Rubin, and a lot of online question askers joined together to talk about THE
  ISSUES. The Sargon of Akkad Rubin Report episode talked a lot about classical liberalism,
  which Sargon and Dave both call themselves a \"classical liberal,\" but Dave Ruben
  has said that progressivism is a disease and dislikes Bernie Sanders. Dave agrees
  with Sargon of Akkad regressive left stuff and claims \"the left is no longer liberal,\"
  which thank the non-existent god. When Dave Rubin Carl Benjamin talk about hate
  speech vs free speech, it's laughable. Is this Dave Rubin comedy? Join Peter Coffin
  dissecting The Rubin Report Sargon of Akkad episode in which they refuse to answer
  a question I paid them to answer. Would you expect anything different from a Sargon
  of Akkad Rubin Report? Listen to Dave Rubin regressive left blah blah on The Rubin
  Report. A Dave Rubin Sargon of Akkad combo basically makes perfect sense, that's
  why he streamed Dave Rubin Sargon of Akkad live. Help us caption & translate this
