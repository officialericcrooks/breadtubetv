  public resources scripts static ADVERSARIES takes on a manipultive American Greetings
  Commercial entitled \"Not Alone.\" It's part of the #GiveMeaning campaign and one
  of many greeting card commercial attempts to pull your heartstrings. This American
  Greetings ad, and indeed the whole Give Meaning Campaign, or #GiveMeaning Campaign,
  positions AG for an American Greetings infertility campaign, which is kind of a
  weird form of American Greetings entertainment. American Greetings (organization)
  is really just using greeting cards, pregnancy, support, and friendship to sell
  \"thinking of you\" cards. Help us caption & translate this video! https://amara.org/v/daG6/
