  LAST NIGHTLY explores the comments of Tom Steyer, the largest individual donor for
  the Democratic party, about Bernie Sanders and working families. He says the DNC
  desperately needs to adopt Sanders' platform, and go beyond \"#navigatingtrumpsamerica\"
  stuff. Whether the Democratic National Committee actually starts to take on income
  inequality, the 2016 election democrats didn't go well and the Democrats need to
  prepare for the 2018 elections as well as the 2020 elections. We need single payer,
  even a billionaire hedgefund manager Tom Steyer is all about the fight for 15. He's
  probably not anti-capitalism but he is pro Medicare for all. I think we should realize
  what Tom Steyer Trump statements make sense. Tom Steyer 2020 statements should be
  heeded. On healthcare and medicaid the statements made at the people's summit, or
  hell by Jeremy Corbyn, and realize that socialism is the answer. We need health
  care for all. This is for progressives, it's good progressive news and we will see
  more bernie sanders speech during the bernie sanders 2020 campaign. Help us caption
