  LAST NIGHTLY takes on the Google manifesto. Yes, THAT Google manifesto. The one
  that is very bad about diversity and feminism. It's called \"Google's Ideological
  Echo Chamber. The Google memo doesn't understand that diversity is strength and
  instead attempts to blame the gender gap on women. The writer of the Google internal
  manifesto \"Googles ideological echo chamber\" was fired, but not until Google saw
  the narrative was beyond their control. Women in tech have to deal with gender inequality
  non-stop as it is, and this Google engineer's diversity manifesto is going to embolden
  those who agree with it to work against women in the workplace. The Google manifesto
  scandal makes sense as a loud topic, it's literally an anti-diversity manifesto
  scandal. The Google anti-diversity manifesto begat a full Google anti-diversity
  manifesto scandal, which is warranted. With an anti-diversity manifesto, of course
  women and other marginalized identities are at risk. The Google engineer publishes
  anti-feminist manifesto really shook a lot of people. Help us caption & translate
