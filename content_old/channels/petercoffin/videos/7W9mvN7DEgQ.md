title: The Senate Healthcare Bill (LAST NIGHTLY №48)
date: "2019-09-15T10:37:15+08:00"
description: "Senate Republicans crafted their Senate healthcare bill behind closed
  doors, drawing considerably less news attention than House Republicans, who formally
  drafted their version of the legislation in open sessions. But Democrats believe
  the coming week represents their best and perhaps final chance to thwart repeal
  of the health law. What are the differences between the House and Senate health
  care bills? \U0001F4A5BECOME A PATRON at http://patreon.com/petercoffin CONTRIBUTING.md

  LAST NIGHTLY takes on the senate health care bill to repeal the affordable care
  act. The Senate's version of the American Health Care Act is here, as introduced
  by Mitch McConnell. The gop health care bill was ghastly in the house and is garbage
  as the senate healthcare bill, too. Hopefully people don't even remember the senate
  health care bill 2017, but we now know both the house and senate health care bills.
  Last Nightly attempts to show some differences between house and senate health care
  bills, but keep in mind they are pretty similar if you've seen the senate healthcare
  bill text. The senate healthcare bill name basically doesn't matter, the senate
  healthcare bill 2017 should just be called the senate healthcare bill vote. The
  senate healthcare bill timeline seems pretty short, as the CBO will score it over
  the weekend. The senate healthcare bill committee gave the senate healthcare bill
  summary on Friday. Help us caption & translate this video! https://amara.org/v/daGf/
