  LAST NIGHTLY takes on the issue that Mylan Sells Asthma Treatments While It Quietly
  Invests in Coal. Mylan is also known for the epipen controversy that led to an epipen
  rebate and even an epipen subsidy. Their epipen price hikes did their public image
  no good, but it also doesn't really matter if mylan pharmaceuticals can also make
  money. The Ceo of mylan heather bresch is also kind of a turd. The mylan coal issue
  involves them investing in coal to get tax breaks while producing asthma and COPD
  (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) . Help us caption & translate this video!
