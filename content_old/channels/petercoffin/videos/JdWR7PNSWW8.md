date: "2019-09-15T10:37:25+08:00"
description: "Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act -- the hot button and
  emotionally-charged issue that sharply split his party -- proved to be too difficult
  a task for now, something McConnell acknowledged at a crowded Capitol news conference
  where he was asked bluntly if his \"leadership\" had been \"damaged\" by the process.

  LAST NIGHTLY takes on Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell's continuead Health Insurance
  debacle, but is it a senate healthcare defeat? The senate gop health care bill has
  not been going well and Trump calls on senate to end filibuster after healthcare
  defeat. The senate healthcare bill, which is not the american health care act, is
  being called dead. But the fact is, they don't mess around. They act as if it's
  over so you stop paying attention. Sanders gop health care plan comments are basically
  that the sanders health care act, or Medicare for All, would be better. But bernie
  sander helath care act has a long way to go and this bad senate health care bill,
  the republican health care bill, a secretive health care bill is still around. If
  we ever want single payer we are going to have to keep pushing. Single payer health
  care is the only moral way; and a single payer system should be what we do. The
  single payer debate is over, those for have won. Now we just need to force the government
  to follow us. Help us caption & translate this video! https://amara.org/v/daG4/
