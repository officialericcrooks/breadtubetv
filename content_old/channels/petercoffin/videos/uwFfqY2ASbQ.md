  LAST NIGHTLY coveres the Charleena Lyles shooting. A pregnant woman shot by police,
  yes the woman shot armed with knife but the main important thing is that pregnant
  mother killed by the police. In no way did she deserve to die, the Charleena Lyles
  police shooting was totally without merit and should never have happened. This is
  the recently police shooting in seattle, the seattle police department was involved
  in the Charleena Lyles shooting. A statement from the seattle police department
  of justice says that the police were armed with non lethal weapons and should have
  deployed those against a relatively small person wielding a small weapon and possibly
  not actually even doing anything. It's a shame there even has to be social justice
  news - there should already be social justice. A mother with mental illness killed
  by the police is not something you hear in a country that acts responsably. A pregnant
  mother killed by seattle police should be morally despicable to you. Any pregnant
  woman killed by seattle police, regardless of what they were doing, should be under
  particular scrutiny and the seattle police need to answer for the Charleena Lyles
  shooting. Help us caption & translate this video! https://amara.org/v/daGi/ -~-~~-~~~-~~-~-
