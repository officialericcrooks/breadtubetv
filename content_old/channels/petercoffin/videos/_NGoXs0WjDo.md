description: "Before arranging a meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer he
  believed would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton, Donald
  Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the material was part of a Russian government
  effort to aid his father’s candidacy, according to three people with knowledge of
  the email. \U0001F4A5BECOME A PATRON at http://patreon.com/petercoffin CONTRIBUTING.md

  LAST NIGHTLY covers the breaking news that Trump Jr. Was Told in Email of Russian
  Effort to Aid Campaign. Apparently, the Russian government was the subject of an
  email to Donald Trump Jr. This isn't necessarily hard, convictable evidence of Russia
  collusion, but it seems pretty clear some kind of Russian interference was ran.
  A Russia lawyer met with Don jr, and Trump jr was told in email about russia effort
  to aid campaign. Repeat: Trump jr was told in email of Russia effort to aid campaign.
  It's astounding Donald Trump jr would meet with a moscow lawyer with the heat that
  was already being applied on Donald Trump even at this point last summer. Trump
  jr was featured in the New York Times for meeting with this Russian lawyer, possibly
  talking about campaign help. Progressive and liberal activists might be suspicious,
  but it's important to understand a meeting where someone might give dirt on Hillary
  doesn't legally change the situation much unless there was reciprocal action promised
  on the part of a winning President Trump. Help us caption & translate this video!
