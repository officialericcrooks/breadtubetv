  public resources scripts static ADVERSARIES takes on this weird Match.com Father's
  Day Lots of Questions commercial. Weirdly, match.com lots of questions is match.com
  father's day commercial for 2017. No match.com commercial has ever really been particularl
  interesting, and this match.com commercial 2017 isn't changing that. There were
  no match.com commercial 2016 that did it either, but this match.com commercial girl
  shows up in relation to a weird thing a kid does for Father's day. The match.com
  commercial girl with accent isn't anywhere to be seen, but the match.com commercial
  guy annoying is absolutely true. The guy in this match com commercial is terrible
  at handling a household so GUESS WHAT THEY HAVE HIM DO. The match.com commercial
  2015 we don't even remember, so don't even bother asking about match.com commercial
  2014. This one doesn't have a match.com commercial song, but it's at least a little
  less obvious than match.com commercial first date. Help us caption & translate this
