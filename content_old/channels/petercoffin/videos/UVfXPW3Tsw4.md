title: Election Pre-Post Mortem
date: "2019-09-15T10:37:29+08:00"
description: The 2016 Election is in a few days, and I think we've had enough Hillary
  Clinton and Donald Trump for a century. I don't want to do a post mortem because
  I think we've already been subjected to enough. Let's talk third parties a bit then
  dump Trump, okay?
