  LAST NIGHTLY takes on the delay of the senate health bill. Will they repeal and
  replace? Donald Trump's senate health care bill is not the health care bill we should
  pass. The health care reform we need is #MedicareForAll. mitch mcconell totally
  disagrees. But don't believe \"senate gop health bill on brink of defeat.\" Yes,
  the senate health bill reels as cbo predicts 22 million more uninsured but the senate
  health bill committee is still moving forward on the senate health bill 2017. The
  house bill worked the same way, they didn't do the senate health bill vote. Hopefully
  this isn't what ends up being the us senate health bill. Delaying the senate vote
  on health care bill might be positive, but they could move forward on the senate
  reconciliation health care bill. Here's more info on the current health care bills
  in senate. Help us caption & translate this video! https://amara.org/v/daGd/ -~-~~-~~~-~~-~-
