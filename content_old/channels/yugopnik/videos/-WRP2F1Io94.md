title: Slavic Stereotypes and Minority representation in Western Media - An Eastern
  European Critique
date: "2019-09-15T10:39:55+08:00"
description: This topic is very close to my heart, as It's never really talked about.
  Even though I've considered myself a "Citizen of the World" the particular misrepresentation
  of my own culture has always cut deep. This though does not mean I endorse "cultural
  representation" in modern media as a simple profit source. In this critique I look
  at the intent behind creating diverse media - instead of diverse media itself.
