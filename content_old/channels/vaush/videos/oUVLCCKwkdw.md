title: Hunter Avallone Challenged me on Twitter and Frankly I'm Giddy
date: "2019-09-15T10:39:50+08:00"
description: Part 1 of 3 in which we test Hunter Avalonne's assertion that his newer
  YouTube videos are more mature and well-substantiated than his older ones. Is he
  right? Is his newer content more worthy of praise? You probably already know the
  answer.
