description: 'In our first episode back for the new year, we explore the president''s
  lies, racism, dumbness, completely fabricated border crisis, and the media''s unfortunate
  inability to report on him accurately and effectively. Also, conservative media
  and politicians'' possibly purposeful inability to grapple with and acknowledge
  Steve King''s lifetime of racist beliefs and ideas. Perhaps these are all related
  topics. Support SOME MORE NEWS: http://www.patreon.com/SomeMoreNews SUBSCRIBE to
