description: 'Some More News presents a special preview of our podcast, Even More
  News with Cody Johnston and Katy Stoll. In today''s episode, Cody and Katy discuss
  Ben Shapiro''s fans and parenting skills, and the value of comforting your crying
  child by citing a statistic about the percentage of female enrollment in dental
  school in 2014. They also talk about Comey''s "bombshell" interview, the tragic
  #WeToo life of Charlie Rose, and the potentially irresponsible portrayal of police
  gun use on very good sitcoms that we love, trust us. You can subscribe to the podcast
