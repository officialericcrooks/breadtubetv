title: Pewdiepie and The Rebranding of White Nationalism
date: "2019-09-15T10:33:42+08:00"
description: In this video, I discuss the intentional rebranding of White Nationalism
  and I question what Pewdiepie's responsibility is in the recent Christchurch terrorist
  attack. Unfortunately, I had warned Youtube that something like this would happen
  and I hate to say that it didn't shock me when it did.
