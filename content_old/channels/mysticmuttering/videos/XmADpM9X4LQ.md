  This song is dedicated to everybody who is going to fight for freedom in Denver & St. Paul this summer, and to all those who will keep the fight alive in their local towns. Also, to Mo, the Fantabulous Four & everybody I met that day in Boston for lighting a big ol' fire under my ass.
  This song was written to be very easy to sing in groups, even large ones, because it was inspired by a sea shantey.
  It was written to be easily singable in large groups, one person singing the first and third lines, and the whole group joining in on the "Keep on Pushin'" bits. Example:
  Person: "Sisters & brothers in the struggle are we" Group: "Keep on pushin' till a change come around." Person: "What benefits you will benefit me!" Group: "Keep on pushin' till a change come around!"
  And so on and so forth. Some verses that I left out of this version because I thought they did not quite fit with the song's punk aesthetic go like this:
  When the sky is gray and the end seems nigh (keep on pushin'. . .) I'll sing sweet songs to keep our spirits high (keep on pushin'. . .)
  When victory comes and the sky is blue (keep on . . .) I will praise all those who saw it thru (keep on . . .)
  we don't look like much when we stand alone (keep on. . .) but people united can't be overthrown (keep on. . .)
  When corporate giants come to our block (keep on. . .) We'll knock them dead with a single rock! (keep on. . .)

  . . . And for gosh sakes, why stop there? The meter is simple enough that any protester worth her/his Food Not Bombs burgoo can come up with still more verses. Used intelligently, this song will help hearten any protest group you sing it with.
