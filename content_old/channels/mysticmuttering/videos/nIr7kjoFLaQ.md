description: 'My cover of Pete Wilde’s track, People In Trees, which I first heard
  in the classic eco-anarchist film “Pickaxe.” This is dedicated to the activists,
  musicians, and filmmakers who inspire me constantly and my subscribers, past, present,
  and future. If you want to help the channel grow, please like and subscribe! If
