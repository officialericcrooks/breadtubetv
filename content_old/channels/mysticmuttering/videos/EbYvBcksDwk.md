description: 'In 1381, the English peasants rose against King Richard II, demanding
  an end to the poll tax, punishment of abusive nobles, abolition of serfdom, and
  some called for the end of the entire feudal system. They were brutally crushed,
  their leaders gruesomely executed, but their spirit never died. I wrote this ballad
  to the tune of the sea shanty “My Son John,” and it’s my hope that people pick it
  up to sing at protests, direct actions, and such. REMEMBER- the reactionaries of
  the world do NOT have a monopoly on tradition; modern radicals can find inspiration
  in any era. We forget our long-dead comrades at our peril. If you want to help the

  He’s left the fields and gone to war The smith has taken his plowshare To forge
  a shield boss and a spear Sing a way down to London town hey for the rebels and
  a hey derry down There was a time when we were free But the nobles think we’re property
  They send the dogs of their cruel tax Who grope our girls and break our backs Sing
  a way down to London town hey for the rebels and a hey derry down We put the taxmen
  all to flight We sent out horsemen through the night If you would be free, for once
  and all, Rise up and heed Wat Tyler’s call! Sing a way down to London town hey for
  the rebels and a hey derry down Our numbers swelled, we broke the Gaols The nobles
  raged to no avail And ev’ry corner of the land It echoed with our loud demand Sing
  a way down to London town hey for the rebels and a hey derry down Mass was led by
  good John Ball, A preacher loved by rebels all “When Adam delved and Eve span Who
  was then the gentleman” Sing a way down to London town hey for the rebels and a
  hey derry down With bold Jack Straw and Ploughman Piers We entered London with no
  fears The King hid in his tower strong While the streets did ring with blood and
  song Sing a way down to London town hey for the rebels and a hey derry down The
  King in terror did agree All former serfs would now be free But at Smithfield, we
  were betrayed They laid Wat Tyler in his grave Sing a way down to London town hey
  for the rebels and a hey derry down Ye peasants all, ye rebels bold Heed well the
  story I have told You have all the power that you need To rid yourself of a tyrant’s
  greed Sing a way down to London town hey for the rebels and a hey derry down'
