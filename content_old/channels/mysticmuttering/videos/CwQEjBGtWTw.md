description: 'Why do some people get over romantic rejection quickly and easily and
  other people don''t? How can we deal with heartbreak without turning into literal
  monsters? This video began life as an advice article I wrote for Fabulously Feminist
  magazine a few years back, and I want to thank Callie for her editorial help as
  well as my friend Vincent for his input on the title, and my partner for their cameo
  as the cute woman in flannel. Sources: Stoicism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu7n0XzqtfA
