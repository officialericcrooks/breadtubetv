description: 'A piece of original utopian fiction set on an English country estate
  and village being run along syndicalist lines. The story takes the form of a diary
  entry, recounting a momentous day in the life of an unnamed farm worker. Thanks
  to my comrades for the seed of this idea and the courage to make it a thing. The
  music is based on Halantow, the Halston May Day carol. Merch Here: https://www.teepublic.com/user/mysticmuttering'
