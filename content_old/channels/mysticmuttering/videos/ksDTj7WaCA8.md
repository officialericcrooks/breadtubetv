description: Have some lyrics! When a hush quiets Facebook and Twitter As the stars
  begin to appear They're nodding off all over Reddit And snoring from 4chan I hear
  So I get my guitar and my webcam And tuck in the sleepy blogrolls And then I tune
  up and quite softly I sing to the Internet trolls Lullabye and goodnight Count your
  .gif sheep You can troll in the morning But for now get some sleep Dream of lulz,
  dream of /b And how to form babby Dream of lulz, dream of /b All your base are belong
  to me And once all the trolls are a-snoozing and the tubes are all safe for a while
  All the folks that they were abusing Sing out in an old fashioned style! On the
  YouTube, the mighty YouTube, The trollers sleep tonight On the YouTube, the quiet
  YouTube, The trollers sleep tonight . ... *yawns* G'night everybody! Tru3bad0ur's
