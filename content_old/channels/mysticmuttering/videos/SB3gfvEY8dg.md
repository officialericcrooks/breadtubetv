description: 'A quick primer on perhaps the easiest hex in all the magickal world.
  Use only on people and institutions that threaten your life and freedom. You will
  need: one jar, any size, with lid (I use the Seal of Solomon from the Goetia on
  the lid for my own protection) nine (or thirteen, depending on your tradition) nails,
  pins, needles, screws, etc. Poppets (commonly called voodoo dolls - representations
  of those you wish to hex. I use cut out paper inscribed with names and symbols)
  Happy Hexing! NO PASARAN! Merch here: https://www.teepublic.com/user/mysticmuttering'
