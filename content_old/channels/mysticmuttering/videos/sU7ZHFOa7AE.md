description: 'A song for the Gilets Jaunes protesters, written to the melody of an
  old Union hymn, the Miner’s Lifeguard. They are part of a long tradition of street
  action for a better world, and I hope especially that my friends in Commercy and
  around the world on the front lines of the struggle will enjoy it. If you want to
  make your own version, feel free! Against fascism, against neoliberalism, and for
  a green planet full of peace and plenty for all. Merch here: https://www.teepublic.com/user/mysticmuttering'
