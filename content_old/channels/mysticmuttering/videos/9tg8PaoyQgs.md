description: This song is a tribute to Sunil "Sunny" Tripathi, a young man whose disappearance
  and death is the subject of an internationally acclaimed documentary, Help Us Find
  Sunil Tripathi. I had seen the posters his family and the army of friends and volunteers
  put up literally all over Providence, and it was only after his death that I heard
  the ugly rumors that started online about him, implicating him as a suspect in the
  Boston Marathon bombing. The lyrics just came to me one morning many months after
  the fact. I recorded this live at my friend Ben's tiny desk at my office.
