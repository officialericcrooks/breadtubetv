  the body of the video - I''m happy to re-edit if it''s worth it to y''all. This
  one is a secondhand Zen koan that I first heard in a book by the late lamented Robert
  Anton Wilson, whose work can be found here: http://www.rawilson.com/ Anyone curious
  about how to run a society free from coercion and looking for possible ways, means,
  and analytical tools to get there should check out this playlist: https://youtu.be/HwJBI6lWmpQ
