  Happy New Year! Have a song! Sing it in the streets! Sing it to your friends! I wish you everything you wish yourself on this happy and auspicious occasion!

  Woody Guthrie's New Years' Resolutions: http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/12/27/woody-guthrie-1942-resolutions-list/
  Lyrics:
  When a blow is struck somewhere for freedom When the trumpets of uprising sound From New York to the streets of Tunisia It's a vict'ry the whole world around!
  When the masses take charge of the masters When their unabashed voices resound When compassion replaces oppression It's a vict'ry the whole world around
  And we sing ole (ole ole!)! Huzzah and hooray! (Hooray! Hooray!) For friends and good fortune we've found! And tomorrow we'll fight (we'll fight! We'll fight!) but for tonight let's celebrate A vict'ry the whole world around!
  When the centuried silence is broken When a lost cause somehow gets found When the plebs make the plutocrats topple It's a vict'ry the whole world around!
  When a victim turns into a hero When a pundit turns into a clown When a meme turns into a movement It's a vict'ry the whole world around

  And we sing . . . .
  If your moment was not quite newsworthy Don't beat yourself up or down Even if no one read the story It's a victry the whole world around
  So whatever the contribution You bring to this old dancing ground Be it large be it small, we will welcome them all! They're all vict'ries the whole world around!
  And we sing . . . .

  *I am working out the kinks in the sound quality. Thanks for understanding!*
