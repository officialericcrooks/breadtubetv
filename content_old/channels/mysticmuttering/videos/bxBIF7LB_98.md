  Ever hear a ragtime diss track before? Well. . . here you go.
  Lyrics

  Well grab your buddies and take a stroll Right down to the old straw poll It's election season in Wonderland Well the Mad Hatter and the March Hare And their tea party buddies will all be there It's election season in wonderland
  The candidates are lined up on the stage Where common sense is all the rage
  And Constitution scholars take their stand Oh vo vodeo They don't like Commies in the Grand Old Party Just like in the days of Joe McCarthy It's election season in Wonderland Now the Cheshire Cat will moderate At the beginning of the great debate It's election season in Wonderland He'll sit and smile while they prattle away And bash the Left and the poor and gay It's election season in Wonderland!
  America, they say, has fallen 'cause Obama's worse than ol' Joe Stalin But they are ready to lend us all a hand Oh vo vodeo They'd shift the world right off it's axis For deregulation and lower taxes It's election season in Wonderland
  Well the tea and rhetoric are piping hot They're giving it everything they've got It's election season in Wonderland On the other side of the looking glass Where they ain't afraid to talk out their ass It's election season in Wonderland
  Watch them scream and hoot and holler And worship the Almighty Dollar But don't jump on the wagon with their band Cast a vote for jobs and schools Not for those Tea Party fools It's election season in Wonder- Election season in Wonder- Election season in Wonderland!
