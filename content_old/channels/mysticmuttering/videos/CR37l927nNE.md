  A marching anthem for our time, putting the Occupy Wall St. in a global perspective
  Chords: Em Em/ Am Em / BMajor Em
  A fire started In old Tunisia O Bella ciao, bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao A fire started in old Tunisia And it burned their tyrant down
  The fire traveled Across to Egypt O Bella ciao, bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao The fire traveled Across to Egypt And Mubarak was forced to flee
  Now the same fire Burns just as brightly O Bella ciao, bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao The same fire Burns just as brightly In old New York tonight

  The whole world over Is one big union O Bella ciao, bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao The whole world over is one big union That keeps the fire of freedom bright
  The fire of freedom Burns our oppressors O Bella ciao, bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao The fire of freedom Burns our oppressors Till we all reach victory!
