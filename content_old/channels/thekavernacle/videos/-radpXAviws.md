title: DEBUNKING Alt-Right Myths about the First Crusade
date: "2019-09-15T10:39:36+08:00"
description: The alt-right and general conservatives like to paint the First Crusade
  as a defence of Christendom after sustained Muslim attack since the Islamic Empire
  spread to Iberia in 711 and was finally halted in Tours, France in 732. I debunk
  these myths and give the topic the nuance it requires.
