description: 'It was recently argued to me that what Black Pigeon Speaks does is,
  though unethical, permissible, because we shouldn''t hold entertainers to academic
  standards. I vociferously disagree. He is presenting other people''s words as if
  they were his own. He cannot hide behind saying that he is an entertainer as a defense.
  If you disagree, be honest with yourself. Had we not pointed this out, you would
  have assumed that the very words we exposed as plagiarism were his. This community
  suffers from a serious ethics problem. Instead of citing their sources, some plug
  their merch stores. Instead of investigating other''s sources, some insult and ask
  for your Patreon support. And some, when selling you their spoken words, plagiarize
  those words or ideas from other people verbatim. Being an entertainer is not a blank
  check on being unethical, and attitudes like that will be the death of alternative
  media. I am not your news source. I don''t want to be your news source. I want you
  to assume, with every claim I make, that I''m lying, and I want you to investigate
  for yourself. I leave my sources for you to hold me accountable. If I get something
  wrong, I want you to scream it at me until I make a correction. This is the standard
  I hold myself to. Why can''t it be the standard for everyone else? My Twitter: https://twitter.com/LibSanityYT_
