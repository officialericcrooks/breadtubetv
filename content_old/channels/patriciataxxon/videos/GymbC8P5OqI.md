description: far away i could sense the world becoming grand perfectly confined for
  us far away i could sense the people turning round and holding hands forever we
  are who we are we are who we are forever we're perfect as stars we're perfect as
  stars forever far away i could sense the beauty coming down in the future where
  we all care for us far away i could sense the angels coming down and for once i
  wanted the next day to come we are who we are we are who we are forever we're perfect
  as stars we're perfect as stars forever
