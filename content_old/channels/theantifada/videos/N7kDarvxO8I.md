  Gang gets down to the hidden history of the National Welfare Rights Organization
  of the 1960s-70s. How does capitalism shape the domestic sphere? How have people
  organized around reproductive labor? Should we demand wages for housework, or wages
  against housework?! Disruption of the status quo gets the goods off the shop floor,
  too! Valerie Solanas feminism vs. $hillary KKKlinton feminism. What''s the deal
  with all this Universal Basic Income talk? Should we be afraid that our Silicon
  Valley overlords are talking about it, or can there be a left UBI that doesn''t
  result in the Hunger Games? Sean rants about the calculation of human life in monetary
  terms. Jamie rants about how Laura Loomer deserves no respect, let alone any Jewish
  lawyer boyfriends. Wilson confesses to getting cockblocked by Marxist feminism on
  a romantic evening with a hot firefighter. Follow the AF crew on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/the_antifada
