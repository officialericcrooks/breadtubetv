  part one of a monster episode, we sit down with Justin Charles of North Brooklyn
  DSA and the AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color Caucus. Sean is scarred by a
  perilous bus journey. Rachel Maddow and the libs freak out about potential peace
  (oh no!) on the Korean Peninsula. Democrats ''Russia Russia Russia'' themselves
  into becoming the NatSec party. Who cares if 81% of South Koreans want an end to
  the war? (Not the lamestream media!) Super deep dive: where does ''identity politics''
  come from? Does the left foster conflict between racial groups as per weeping moron
  Jordan Peterson, or is ''race'' a historically constructed category with no basis
  in biology? Jamie explains the Marxist concept of ''real abstraction''. Justin on
  how the term ''identity politics'' was created by the black, lesbian Marxists of
  the Combahee River Collective in 1977. The gang then traces — with help from Adolph
  Reed and the Fields sisters — how this radical conception was watered down into
  neoliberal diversity capitalism. How does the left avoid ''bad'' idpol? What structures
  should socialist organizations put in place to ensure that racialized and gendered
  domination is not reproduced within our movement? Is the AfroSocialist and Socialists
  of Color Caucus a bourgeois radlib beachhead destined to undermine the Democratic
  Socialists of America? (Spoiler alert: nah.) Part two will further the conversation
  by addressing critiques of the caucus before it degenerates into dragging on Elon
  Musk''s utopian anarchist turn. Become a patron starting at just $2/month at patreon.com/theantifada
