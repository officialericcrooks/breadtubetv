  week on the Militant Minority Report, we get even more seditious than usual with
  the help of army resister Spenser Rapone (@punkproletarian). Mike Ness of Social
  Distortion brings a smile to our faces. Spenser''s journey from 18-year-old recruit
  to dank communist meme. The relationship between capitalism and imperialism: Is
  it even possible to oppose war without attacking the wage system? The pitfalls of
  knee-jerk anti-imperialism. A comparative history of resistance and mutiny during
  the Vietnam War and Portugal''s Carnation Revolution, the latter of which overthrew
  a fascist government with hardly any violence. Andy Stapp''s heroic efforts to unionize
  the US Army in the Vietnam era. Will anyone pick up the mantel? The military as
  potential — even essential — site of class struggle, and the various factors working
  for and against that. Could a revolution ever happen here in the dark heart of the
  American empire, and if so, what would it look like? Lastly and most importantly:
  Was Spenser just trolling or does he really think communism will win? Check out
