  The Antifada''s HARD LAUNCH episode, Jamie and Sean speak with socialist power couple
  Doug Henwood and Liza Featherstone about aggression in Syria, the governor''s race
  in New York, and liberal derangement syndrome. Liza does an on-air version of her
  socialist-feminist advice column in The Nation, "Asking for a Friend." Jamie almost
  sells out, but mistakes ice cream for soap so w/e. Sean reminds us that leftists
  don''t make heroes of i-banking cops like James Comey. Doug and Liza talk about
  how they met and their philosophy on makin'' red diaper bbs. Jamie and Liza admit
  they''re only in it for the Bernie bro boyfriends. Check out Doug Henwood at https://lbo-news.com
