  Sean, and Andy are joined by militant documentarian Brandon Jourdan of https://www.globaluprisings.org.
  Brando discusses life as an expat, the indymedia network, and his four seconds of
  fame in Boots Riley''s smash hit "Sorry to Bother You." The crew plays clips from
  Brando and his partner Marianne Maeckelbergh''s films on uprisings in Spain, Turkey
  and the US. Does Brando see himself as part of these movements or just another slack
  jawed servant to the spectacle? The causes of, and potential solutions to, right-wing
  populism around the world. Fascists all have permanent clown wigs: why? Brando breaks
  down right-populism in the Netherlands and why Geert Wilders is a loser. Jamie and
  Sean''s respective run-ins with Geert Wilders and Brexit-boy Boris Johnson. Sean
  goes on one of his trademark rants about why capitalism is in crisis and will stay
  that way for the rest of its (hopefully numbered) days. The limits of liberal multiculturalism.
  Jamie throws Queen Hill Dawg a rare bone. Adam Smith''s theory of "truck, barter,
  and exchange" is Fakenews. SAD! Brando''s sweeping vision for how we can BE THE
  REV and create a new world in 17 easy steps. Check out Brando''s documentaries at
