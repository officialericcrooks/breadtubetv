  the most cerebral episode yet of The Antifada, Jamie and Sean welcome old friend
  Asher Dupuy-Spencer of Verso Books into the studio. The gang talks about Jamie''s
  near death experience at a nazi swimming hole in New Hampshire. We celebrate the
  memory of all-around feminist icon and totally-not ruling class monster-person Barbara
  Bush... leading Jamie to use the strongest genital-related epithet in the English
  language. Asher presents two articles by Vivek Chibber and Charlie Post that debate
  the tactics, strategies and horizons of radical struggle. Oh yeah, and the Antifada
  reveals it''s modest proposal for a kinder, gentler gulag. Articles: https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/12/our-road-to-power
