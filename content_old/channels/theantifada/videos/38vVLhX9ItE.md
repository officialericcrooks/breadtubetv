description: '(This is a PREVIEW of our two part, 3 hr+ histomatraveganza about the
  ''70s. Full episode available for patrons here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/antifadas-is-4-w-27156700
  Patrons get access to our discord community and all our bonus material, including
  History is a Weapon, Jamie and Leslie Lee III''s Vampire Castle, and Andy''s Proletkult.
  Thank you for your support!) The boys are back! This History Is A Weapon is so massive
  (and inebriated) that we had to break it into two parts. In this installment, Matt
  and Sean shoot a little shit about the radical geography of Europe before we plunge
  into the pool of disco and despair that was the 1970s: how the global crisis upended
  the ''Golden Age'' of American capitalism, how Richard Nixon rode a wave of aggrievement
  to become the voice of a ''silent majority'' in backlash, and how the uneasy alliance
  between organized labor and the Democratic Party began to fracture as stagflation
  undermined the post-war compromise. Part II, another goddamn hour-and-a-half of
  historical goodness, will drop later this week to complete the story of how this
  thing called neoliberalism came to dominance, how it, too, is now crumbling, and
  how we might dialectically overcome the limitations of working class self-organization
  evident in previous cycles of struggle.'
