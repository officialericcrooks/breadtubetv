  you thought last episode was arcane, get a load of this shit! We sit down with Ross
  Wolfe of https://thecharnelhouse.org to venture into the farthest, darkest reaches
  of left theory... in order to resurrect the nightmares of dead generations within
  the minds of our listeners. Ross discusses how Sean nearly came to blows with famous
  fashy troll Kantbot at a Verso Books party. Jamie informs Sean that she thought
  he was a violent horror man when they first dated. We debate the monetary value
  of a human rib if it''s broken within a police riot and subsequent lawsuit. Crew
  gets down to discussing the political economy of architecture, the merits of grandiosity
  in construction and the mercenary optimism of high modernist internationalism. Ross
  explains the evolution of the #doom meme and origins of Yacht Communism. Antifada
  then does another deep dive into 20th century theory and practice in a wide-ranging
  discussion of anarchism, council communism, Bordiga, bourgeois barbarism and communization.
  We all end up slightly depressed at the end, but in different and interesting ways.

  including voice chat and premium content - is a mere $5. We''d greatly appreciate
