  community for as little as $5 a month at https://www.patreon.com/theantifada The
  gang is joined by writer David Klion (@DavidKlion) to talk New York''s Democratic
  primaries, the socialist read on Trump/Russia, and the need for a left internationalism.
  The various reactions to Julia Salazar''s NY State Senate win and what it means
  when the libs think they have to be nice to us. We all drag the fuck out of hasbara
  hack Bari Weiss, of whose bad takes Sean cannot get enough. Jamie and Sean get divorced
  x 2. What, if anything, can the left take away from the Trump/Russia story? David
  breaks it down with help from comrades Bill Maher and Rachel Maddow. Jamie goes
  off on a cowardly Harrington-ite for his smarmy, disingenuous, red-baiting, left-punching
  op-ed. International super-friends Bernie and Yanis spit hot bars on foreign policy.
  All this, plus a new commie karaoke! https://www.twitter.com/DavidKlion Antifada
