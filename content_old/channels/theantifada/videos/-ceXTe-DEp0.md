  (dropping later this week)! https://www.patreon.com/theantifada In this very special
  Antifada offering, Andy, Jamie and Sean are joined by your favorite sons: Matt Christman
  and Virgil Texas of Chapo Trap House. Gang begins by addressing the central questions
  of our hyper-digital age: what if God friended you on Facebook? Is QAnon just a
  benign hobby for bored Boomers? And, holy shit, what if GOD WAS QANON? Matt, Virgil
  and Jamie reveal - for the very first time - their respective political tendencies.
  Everyone marvels at how high-T Jeb(!) managed to lose the primary despite the PR
  coup of offering a poorly branded guaca bowle. Crew get knee-deep into Paul Schrader''s
  1978 classic "Blue Collar" starring Richard Pryor, Yaphet Kotto and Harvey Keitel''s
  genitalia. How does this movie about struggling union autoworkers help us understand
  the 70s as more than just bad hair and bell bottoms? (C.f. Jefferson Cowie''s "Stayin''
  Alive" and the upcoming "Chapo Guide to Revolution: A Manifesto Against Logic, Facts
  and Reason") How did the "Golden Age" of US capitalism break down? How the hell
  did we end up in neoliberal hellworld when the 70s saw the most massive wildcat
  strike wave since the 30s? Why can''t we return to decadent late social-democracy
  complete with coke benders, shag carpets to bang across, crushed velvet noodie posters
  and modernist chairs made to look like cocks''n''balls? Ugh. After the depressing
  grind of Blue Collar, Matt suggests we lighten the mood with "Gung Ho" (1986) starring
  Michael Keaton. What''s more uplifting after watching a film about declining racial
  solidarity among the US working class than one that uses stereotypes about the Japanese
  for cheap yuks? What''s more laughable than watching a town full of autoworker rubes
  look to a washed up high school jock to solve their employment crisis? In a startling
  twist, the entire crew turns on the American working class as the indolent, entitled
  chuds they are: you will all wear Ribbons of Shame in the highly disciplined and
  sadistic Japanese-dominated future! Luckily, this week''s viral wildcat video by
  a Hero of Socialist Labor saves us from going full MAGA. Spoiler: in the end our
  various tendencies are synthesized into Antoine Dangerfield Thought. Become a patron
  today to access more content and hang out with us in our rad Discord community.
