  community for as little as $5 a month at https://www.patreon.com/theantifada After
  our intended guests fell through, we were surprised and pleased to be joined by
  Comrade Communicator of the Intergalactic Workers League, who was inspired to appear
  by the troubling news of Trump''s weird Space Force proposal. Seems dumb, but how
  about the extraterrestrial militarization of Ronny Raygun? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMfmVzHZvkc
  Next, in a Marxist-Ufologist version of Crossfire, AP Andy faces off against our
  guest in ideological combat over the legacy and relevance of 20th-Century Argentine
  socialist thinker and head of the Latin American section of the 4th International,
  J Posadas. The situation gets tense between the two as the historical tradition
  of heterodox Trotskyism confronts the new synthesis of Comrade High Commander''s
  Neo-Posadism. Was Posadas a total wackjob or was there continuity between his ideas
  and the catastrophism of Leon Trotsky? Is the popularity of Internet Posadist memes
  a reflection of deeper world-historical forces or mere revisionism? How did Cuban
  Trotskyists under the influence of Posadas give birth to nuclear accelerationism?
  Will socialism arise out of proletarian self-organization or through the intervention
  of that vanguard that stands outside of history: the extraterrestrial Space Comrades?
  Gang dives into the famous Posadas Flying Saucers communique: https://www.marxists.org/archive/posadas/1968/06/flyingsaucers.html
  Andy counterposes his own Marxist-Ufology research: https://theoutline.com/post/5384/the-secret-history-of-marxist-alien-hunters?zd=1&zi=jg4c3k6q
  As always on Antifada, the most pressing issues facing humanity are addressed: water-birth
  and the ''New Socialist Man''; poly-Posadism vs volcel-Socialism; first contact
  and Enemy Alien Propaganda; the abolition of time as a transitional program; proletarian
  prepperism; and the necessity of uniting with dolphins, our class brothers and sisters
  of the sea. Stay tuned for a special bonus episode, for patrons only, of Real Posadas
  Hours with IWL-P''s Comrade Communicator. And always remember: David Ickism and
  Alex Jones Thought are the Posadism of fools! Become a supporter of The Antifada
