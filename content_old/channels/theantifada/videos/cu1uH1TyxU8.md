  community for as little as $5 a month at https://www.patreon.com/theantifada The
  Antifada crew is back from vacation and ready to pop off once more. This week, we
  are joined by fellow Goth socialist podcaster Jake Flores (@feraljokes) for a discussion
  of comedy, politics, and the joys of amyl nitrate. How has his now infamous visit
  from the DHS impacted Jake''s career? Is there such a thing as an objectively problematic
  joke? Which side of the rev will the Upright Citizens Brigade be fighting on? All
  this, plus Sean defends Comrade George Carlin from the attacks of snarky millennials.
