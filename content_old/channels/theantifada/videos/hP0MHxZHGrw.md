  community for as little as $2 a month at https://www.patreon.com/theantifada After
  a relaxing day drinking nutcrackers at the beach, Aaron of the ISO and the Antifada
  crew hit the studio to podcast and chill. Our hate was impure. Then things went
  horribly wrong. We start on a bright enough note with DSA''s Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez''s
  stunning victory in the BX/QNS primary. The usual back and forth about leftists
  and electoralism yada yada yada. Next, the destruction of Weird NYC. The structurally
  reactionary nature of the judiciary. Jamie gets livid over the crisis pregnancy
  center decision, but not before she is possessed by the ghost of Alex Jones. Fucking
  scab-ass Mark Janus. (FUCK YOU!) Gems: David Axelrod''s mustache is the perfect
  implement for toilet cleaning; Shane Smith''s mansion as union propaganda; Adderall
  as cure for absolute surplus value; witch circles; Seymour Hersh collaborating with
  Brazzers. It was a wild ride and maybe our favorite ep yet! Follow Aaron: https://www.twitter.com/ughitsaaron
