title: Richard Wolff On How US Senate Favors Finance Over You
date: "2019-09-15T10:38:23+08:00"
description: The U.S. Senate killed a new ban on financial companies requiring customers
  to give up their right to sue in order to open accounts. Banks, credit card issuers
  and other financial companies will be able to block customers from banding together
  to sue over disputes, after the U.S. Senate on Tuesday narrowly killed a rule banning
  the firms from using "forced arbitration" clauses.
