title: 'Voluntourism: doing more harm than good?'
date: "2019-09-15T10:33:43+08:00"
description: I discuss the neocolonial and neoliberal elements of voluntourism. How
  it promotes the white saviour complex, poverty aesthetics, cultural cannibalism,
  promotes the demonstration effect, cultural insensitivity, white manâ€™s burden and
  uneven development. It can also enhance a lack of long term planning and can increase
  unemployment and dependency on the west.
