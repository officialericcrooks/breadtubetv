title: 'Leaving Neverland: Paedophilic Culture, Heteronormativity and Silencing of
  Victims'
date: "2019-09-15T10:33:43+08:00"
description: In this video I discuss the importance of Leaving Neverland from my perspective
  as a child sexual abuse survivor. I attempt to bring the conversation surrounding
  this documentary back to challenging our inadequate judicial system, paedophilic
  culture, child sexual abuse generalisations, the silencing of victims, heteronormativity
  and patriarchy.
