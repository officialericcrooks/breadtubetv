  Recommended reading: “The Social Construction of What?” by Ian Hacking, particularly
  chapter 1 for an introduction - https://larvalsubjects.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/hacking-the-social-construction-of-what2.pdf
  “Social Construction” by A. Sveinsdóttir, in Philosophy Compass Volume 10 Issue
  12 (I have a physical copy of this but cannot find it online, if anyone does please
  let me know) I quoted The Social Construction of Reality at pages 13 and 15 - http://perflensburg.se/Berger%20social-construction-of-reality.pdf
  Note on the categories at 8:33: Ian Hacking also lists one attitude he calls “unmasking”
  that sits at the same level as “reformist”. I didn’t include this for the sake of
  brevity. This is when it is shown how something is contingent in order to undermine
  its authority, when showing that it’s contingent is good enough in itself. Reformist
  attitudes can also be unmasking, and vice versa, but they do not have to be. Footage
