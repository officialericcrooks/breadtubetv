  I''d like to repeat that I''m not against using "equality" in political slogans,
  but this works for the most part only among people who already have similar political
  goals and therefore know on some intuitive level what specific types of equality
  the other person is talking about. Thanks to my friend Finn for reading out the
  Engels quote. Recommended reading: "Critique of the Gotha Programme" by Karl Marx
  (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/) "Philosophy and Real Politics"
  by Raymond Geuss - Part II Failures of Realism, Equality Anarchopac''s video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIhIM-jge2c
  I quoted Engels from "Engels to August Bebel In Zwickau (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/letters/75_03_18.htm)
  And Angela Davis from "Are Prisons Obsolete?", page 75 (https://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Angela-Davis-Are_Prisons_Obsolete.pdf)
  Here is the full Jordan Peterson interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T7pUEZfgdI
  I used clips from "The Young Karl Marx" (2017), as well as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG_OvL9FZVQ
