  Disclaimer: I know “postmodern” is often an unhelpful term and Derrida himself never
  labeled himself or his work “postmodern”. Even just labeling the analysis "post-structuralist”
  would’ve been better in terms of accuracy, but all I wanted is a catchy title. (Also
  maybe the title will get me more views because of the commotion about postmodernism
  that Jordan Peterson caused.) Sources: On Derrida: https://www.iep.utm.edu/derrida/
