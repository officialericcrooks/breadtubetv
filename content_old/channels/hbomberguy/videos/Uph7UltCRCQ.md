title: Lords of the Fallen is a Difficult But Balanced Game
date: "2019-09-15T10:33:27+08:00"
description: Lords of the Fallen is 'like Dark Souls', only a hundred thousand times
  better. A 'Speed Run' of this game is actively a better fighting strategy than real
  fighting. You can beat almost any boss by running at them and mashing the 'hold
  shield button''. I have a dozen hours of this on my hard drive.
