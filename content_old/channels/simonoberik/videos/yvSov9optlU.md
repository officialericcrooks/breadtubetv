title: 'Video Essay: Nihilism in television'
date: "2019-09-15T10:38:27+08:00"
description: This video examines how nihilism is established and treated in the current
  TV landscape. The video particularly deals with the character-driven nihilism of
  Rick and Morty before moving on to nihilism not bound by individual characters,
  but instead of elements surrounding them. My intentions with this video is twofold.
  One, I wish to entertain my viewers. Two, I wish to educate people on what to notice
  when analysing a piece of TV or cinema philosophically. Nihilism in media isn't
  confined to the existential kind. It's hard to define precisely as the term has
  had a muddy past. Instead, it leans up against a philosophical/philosophy movement
  like postmodernism, although there are key differences between the two.
