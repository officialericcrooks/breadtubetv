description: 'In our unlucky 13th episode, the Current Affairs panel gets into the
  Halloween spirit: we investigate the murder of American democracy, Pete makes the
  case that Halloween is the best holiday, and we all share our favorite unsolved
  mysteries. Support Current Affairs by becoming a patron on our Patreon page: patreon.com/CurrentAffairs.
  For the written form of Current Affairs — and to subscribe to the beautiful print
  magazine — visit: CurrentAffairs.org. To join the conversation, leave us a voicemail
  at 504-867-8851.'
